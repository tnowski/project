        Thanks to climate change, lakes will experience longer and more intense periods of extreme surface temperatures by the end 
        of this century, according to a study published in January’s edition of Nature by researchers at the European Space Agency 
        Climate Office. These periods of extreme temperature, called lake heatwaves, can have permanent negative impacts on lake 
        ecosystems and humans. <br>
        
        Although scientists have known lakes are warming in general, this study explores how the specific heatwave events lakes 
        experience will become more extreme, says Tom Shatwell, a lake researcher at the Helmholtz Association’s Center for 
        Environmental Research in Magdeburg, Germany, who is affiliated with the study. “No one's actually really investigated 
        the heatwaves before, not in the context of climate change,” he says. The study uses historical atmospheric data to predict 
        daily surface temperatures until 2099 for 702 lakes around the world in low, moderate and high carbon dioxide emission scenarios. <br>

        Heatwave intensity and duration grew increasingly extreme with the increase in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted in each of 
        the three scenarios. In the highest emissions scenario, lake heatwaves may eventually last as much as 12 times longer and measure 
        more than 5 degrees Celsius hotter than the average heatwave today. <br>

        When faced with hotter temperatures near the lake’s surface, fish will become stressed and seek cooler temperatures toward the 
        bottom of the lake. However, these deep areas may not have enough oxygen to be suitable for the fish, leaving them strained from 
        below as well as from above. As lake heatwaves lengthen, organisms remain in a state of heat stress for longer, making them more 
        likely to die or have fewer offspring. <br>

        It is difficult to forecast the complex interactions caused by more extreme heatwaves. However, in general, the growing intensity 
        of heatwaves increases the risk of severe ecological impacts, which may have repercussions on lake-related industries such as 
        fishing or public services like municipal water supplies. For example, Shatwell says, warmer water can encourage harmful algal 
        blooms, which are toxic to both aquatic species and humans. <br>

        Once lake warming does occur, it is nearly impossible to reverse, says Catherine O’Reilly, an aquatic ecologist at Illinois 
        State University who is unaffiliated with the study. “It's really hard to envision a way to air condition a lake,” O’Reilly 
        says. <br>

        To protect lakes from irreversible warming, Shatwell says it’s important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create lake 
        management programs to maintain good water quality. “Nice clean lakes that have healthy ecosystems may still warm with the 
        atmosphere, but they're more resilient to the changes that are the consequences,” he says. <br>

        O’Reilly agrees, stressing the importance of taking action now: “The changes that we make right now will be the ones that 
        influence which trajectory we’re on,” she says. <br>

        If we follow a trajectory of severe emissions, O’Reilly says, the environments around us will be fundamentally different: 
        “It’s going to be like living on a different planet.”
